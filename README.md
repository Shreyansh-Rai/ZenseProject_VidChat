Project Name: Glimpse
Created By : Shreyansh Rai IMT2020501
How to run in order to test it?
  - - -
Go to the repository https://github.com/Shreyansh-Rai/ ZenseProject_VidChat
Clone the project locally and go to the directory where the project is cloned
Now run the command : npm i

Now run the command: npx nodemon server.js to start the backend locally the program runs on the port number 5000 so in your browser after the server has started running, visit localhost:5000 and the application will automatically assign a room to the user joining and the user will be redirected to it.
To allow others to join the same room the link (in the address bar of the browser) has to be shared to them and they can also join the meeting using the link.
 
I advise testing the application locally before going to heroku the reason will be explained at a later point in this report where I explain the challenges faced during the projectâ€™s development.

Joining the above link will then redirect you to a room and sharing that link with others will allow them to join you.
